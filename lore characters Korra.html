        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Korra is a shy and introverted person. When to get to know her, she is a very kind-hearted person. Due to fact that she is alone most of the time, she got really in to digital art and painting. She not really a fighter she is mostly peaceful, But that doesn't mean she doesn't accidently hurt people. Due to Korra trying to hide her powers she has really learned to control yet. Sometimes when experiences a high levels of fear it usually causes her to frezee her surroundings. Sometimes this is good self defense, but other times it could be harmful to other. For example if she is experiences a lot of anxitey it cause the whole room to turn in to a giant frezeer for a short period of time. Though she can sometimes fail to control her powers, she is still a nice friend to have around.</font></code>.</p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Positive Traits: Kind-hearted healer</font></code>.</p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Negative Traits: she is a afraid of people and sometimes loses control of her power due to fear</font></code>.</p>

        <p class="lead"><strong><font color="white">Backstory</font></code>.</strong></p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Korra was always a shy person and for that she didn't really have a lot of friends. As she spends a lot of time alone watching moives and drawing, her gem started to give her ice generation powers. She got this power at a young age (like around 6 years of age) she thought that this power was dangerous a tried to keep them hidden from others. But as she gets older her powers get more powerful and harder to control due to her trying surpress them. What makes this worse is that She doesn't have anyone to help her control her ice abiliies so she has to figure out how to control them by herself. She wasn't the only one in her family to get powers by the way. Her sister Mikizu was gived powers over light. Unlike Korra she is very active and popular among her class, so she barely had anytime to help her sister to control her abilities. Korra didn't really have a lot of friends until her freshmen year of highschool. At the beginning of the school year her and her sister were invited to an afterschool pool party to introduced the new freshmens. They both went to the event and since Mikizu was already known for being a very likeable person, they were treated pretty nicely. Nothing really important happened until after Event. While getting ready to leave, Korra noticed her control of her powers slipping and went somewhere private along to dry off. As she walks off, to a different changing room she runs in to Akairio and accidentally slips and uses her powers. Once soon as realises what she's done, she sprints to a changing room and thinks about what just happened. After she leaves the changing room she was confronted by Akairio and he asked her about her powers. Korra was very uncomfortable with his questions until Akairio reveals that he has Elemental powers as well. Akairio offered to help her control her powers when ever they would meet again, she loved that idea. After years of her have Elemental Abilities someone was finally willing to help her control them. After about 10 months Akairio's Father was working on a fight club with people gifted elemental abilities. Akairio asked Korra if she would be interested in joining. Korra was afraid to join because she thought she hasn't learn enough control or that she was to weak. Akairio Implied that she has gained total control and she'll fit in with the group. She agreed and is new helping him, his dad, and the other 10 fighters with setting up the fight club.</font></code>.</p><font color="white">
