    <p class="lead"><font color="#D90000">Hello, I am Mr. Ruby. That is not my real name because I don't really want to reveal me name yet. It is something that you can call me for now. I'm a 16 year old Animator and Video Game designer and Creator of the Shikato Video-Game Multiverse (aka: SVM). From a Young age I was always interested in computer science, so I always want to be a video game designer but I didn't really have a lot of graphical design skills back then. Until about 18 months ago I got my an animation program called Blender on my computer. After about a month and a half I made a YouTube channel Called Kasai Ruby and posted an animation video. For about the next seven months I was just make tutotials on animation, speed paints and random videos that I wish I can take down Until august 7th I made my first animated skit. The skit was called Baby with a Gun and is now my most viewed and liked video on my entire channel. About two months later I had an idea about a game called Power Grounds. It is a fighting style game with 12 playable characters and 5 maps. This game was changed to Elite Elemental Brawlers because it explains more of the game then Power Grounds. I pushed it of to the side due to the fact it was a big project and I didn't have a lot of time due to school. I Didn't work on this project until early may and thought to post it on a Website dedicated to games that I created. After I release Elite Elemental Brawlers i have plans for two other games afterwards.</font></code>.</p>
