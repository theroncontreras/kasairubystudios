      <p class="lead"><strong><font color="white">Personality</font></code>.</strong></p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Akairio is a mostly chill person. Usually if you're nice to him he is nice to you. He is sometimes know for trolling some of his friends and new people he meets. He rarely loses it with someone but instead tries to reason with them, But that doesn't mean he doesn't lose it at all. When ever someone threatens or attacks someone that he cares about, he very easily loses it with them doesn't even try to reason with them. Sometimes he has been a little over-protective with his friends and family. As a Elemental Brawler he is mostly interested in having a fair fight with the other brawlers. Among the other brawlers there is a reason why he is the head brawler if something would have happened to person running the games.</font></code>.</p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Positive Traits: He is chill person who won't let people harm people he is close to.</font></code>.</p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Negative Traits: Though He protects his friends he sometimes goes overboard with it.</font></code>.</p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Likes: Practice Fighting (Like Sword Fighting, Martial Arts etc), Korra, Swimming in lava, Exploring new private property that his adoptive dad got, Hanging out at the scorching dragon (Aisan Restaurant in the city he lives in)</font></code>.</p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Dislikes: People who threaten the people he is close to, Very high constrations of water (like a large lake)</font></code>.</p><font color="white">
        <hr></font>
        <p class="lead"><strong><font color="white">Backstory</font></code>.</strong></p>
        <p class="lead"><font color="white">Akairio was seperated from his Biological Parents when his was less than a year old. I'm going to keep the reason why they were seperated a secret because it will be used for a plot in a future game. He has been placed in a cardboard box with a blanket and a card with all of his important information. He had been sitting in the box in a alleyway for 36 hours until he was found by his now adoptive father Hiro Sakurai. Shortly after Akairio turn five he had gained the ability to fire bend and be immuned to fire. This gave Hiro the idea for a future fight club idea with people with elemental abilities and fight on teams. A couple of years later Akairio started to gain more of his abilities and has been getting some experience in many multiple martial arts like Northern chow lang Kung fu, taekwondo, and Karate. When Akairio was 12 it was revealed that Akairio has Super Human Speed and Reflexs and was one of the strongest in his class. After two years when Akairio was a freshmen in Highschool he meet his now Girlfriend Korra. Him and Korra had special bond with each other and hanged out frequently. After 10 months later his father Hiro had announced that been looking for people was elemental powers to give rise to a new fight club called Elemental Brawlers. Once Akairio and Korra meet Korra accidentally used her Ice generation abilities after being jumpscared. Due to the fact that they both elemental abilities it caused them to be very close. So when Akairio figured out about the annoucement he Asks her if she would like to join him in the new job offer. She was a little hesitant but she accpeted the offer. As of right now, Akairio is helping set up the fight club with his father, Korra, and the other 10 fighters.</font></code>.</p><font color="white">
